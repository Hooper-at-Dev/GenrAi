üéµ Music Genre Prediction Model
A deep learning model built with Python to predict music genres from audio files using the GTZAN dataset. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for audio classification, leveraging the Librosa library for feature extraction and TensorFlow for building and training the model.

üöÄ Features
Extracts MFCCs and other relevant audio features using Librosa

Trains a custom CNN model for genre classification

Uses the GTZAN dataset containing 10 music genres

Achieves accurate genre prediction on unseen audio samples

NOTE: this model works well with 90s songs, as all the songs in the dataset are of 90s

üß† Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Librosa

NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

üìÅ Dataset
GTZAN Genre Collection: 1000 audio tracks (30 seconds each) across 10 genres.

üìä Genres Included
Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock
